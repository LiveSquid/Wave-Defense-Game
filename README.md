# :crossed_swords: Welcome to The Last Stand: Knightfall :crossed_swords:
### A game made by LiveSquid using vanilla JavaScript
Hi there! this is my first large project and it's still a work in progress.
As the name suggests its a wave defense game where you play as a knight, fending off hoardes of enemies. Earn gold by slaying monsters and use it to purchase upgrades, try and survive for as long as you can! The waves are infinite!
If you find any bugs or have any suggestions please reach out!

# :green_circle:Tips and Tricks:green_circle:
The game is meant to be played in fullscreen | Your range is longer than the monsters, which means you can kite them. (backup - attack - backup - attack..) | Invest in the gold upgrade early | Buying Max Health also heals you!

# :red_circle:Coming Soon:red_circle: 
Second enemy type | More upgrades | Two more Combos
